Comparing Search Engines and Market Share
While completing the activity of comparing search engine results using Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask, I discovered that not all search engines are created equal in terms of relevance, layout, and usability. Google consistently provided the most useful and up-to-date results, with a clean interface that included featured snippets and related questions, which made it easier to navigate and find information quickly. Bing was second in terms of visual appeal but returned more paid ads than Google. Yahoo and Ask delivered less accurate and sometimes outdated content. Additionally, when I searched for search engine market share, I found that Google holds the highest market share globally—significantly more than all other search engines combined. From this activity, I learned that search engine choice can greatly affect the quality and reliability of the information retrieved. In my current academic environment, this knowledge will help me become more selective and efficient when doing research for assignments. In a future workplace setting, using the most effective search engine will save time and ensure I’m working with the most reliable and current information available.
Using Search Operators and Evaluating Sources

In the second activity, I focused on using advanced search techniques like exact phrase searches, Boolean operators, and site-specific queries. I learned that putting phrases in quotation marks, such as "search engine" "market share", returned more accurate and focused results than just typing the keywords without quotes. I also used the site search operator with `site:wikiversity.org`, which helped me target my search results directly within Wikiversity instead of relying on its internal search tool. This method brought up more relevant pages faster. Using Boolean logic such as `"search engine" OR SEO` allowed me to explore a broader range of content. I also reviewed Georgetown University’s guidelines for evaluating online sources and applied them to the results I found, learning to assess reliability based on factors like publication date, author credibility, and domain origin. These skills are directly applicable to both my schoolwork and my future career. In school, I can now conduct more accurate and efficient research. In the workplace, especially in roles that involve data analysis, content creation, or decision-making, being able to quickly retrieve and verify high-quality information is a major advantage
