I learned that each social media platform prioritizes different elements of the Honeycomb Model depending on its purpose and audience. Here's a brief summary of how each platform aligns:

Instagram – Strong in identity, sharing, presence, and reputation. Less support for groups and long form conversations.
LinkedIn – Focuses on identity, relationships, reputation, and groups for professional networking. Less emphasis on casual conversations or presence.
Pinterest – Strong on sharing and reputation. Weak in presence, identity, and conversations.

Understanding Intellectual Property and Illegal File Sharing
The Topic You Are Describing:
This activity focuses on intellectual property laws , particularly those related to music piracy and illegal peer to peer (P2P) file sharing. I reviewed the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)’s “About Piracy” page and researched the legal consequences  individuals may face when engaging in unauthorized downloading, sharing, or distribution of copyrighted content.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have made this practice more common, but they also come with serious legal risks. According to the RIAA and other legal sources, penalties for illegal file sharing can include:
Civil lawsuits, with damages up to \$150,000 per infringed work
Criminal charges, leading to fines and possibly jail time
Permanent records for minors or students caught engaging in piracy
University disciplinary actions , including expulsion or loss of internet privileges
The RIAA has pursued thousands of lawsuits against individuals, including students, to discourage the illegal downloading and sharing of music.
