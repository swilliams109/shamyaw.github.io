        <strong>Activity: Compare Search Engines</strong><br><br>
        In this activity, I compared the results from multiple search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. The goal was to evaluate the usefulness of each search engine and assess their user interfaces. I found that Google had the most user-friendly layout, offered the most accurate and relevant results, and presented them in a clear, easy-to-understand format. Bing was visually clean but displayed more sponsored results. Yahoo and Ask showed older content and were less relevant in comparison. I also searched for search engine market share and discovered that Google dominates with the largest market share by far. Through this activity, I learned how different search engines prioritize content, rank results, and design their user interfaces. I now better understand the importance of choosing the right tool for online research. In both my current academic work and future career, being able to identify the best search engine for a specific need will save me time and help me find high-quality, credible information more efficiently.

        <strong>Activity: Use Search Engines and Search Operators</strong><br><br>
        This activity introduced me to advanced search techniques using Googleâ€™s search operators. I practiced searching with exact phrases by putting quotes around words, like "search engine" "market share", and immediately noticed how much more focused and relevant the results became. I also used site-specific searches, like <code>site:wikiversity.org</code>, which helped me quickly locate targeted information within a trusted site. Using Boolean searches such as "search engine" OR SEO gave me a wider view of related topics.
