Compare Search Engines

In the Compare Search Engines* activity, I explored how various search engines—Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask—deliver different results when searching for the same topic. I learned that search engines not only vary in layout and user interface but also in how they prioritize content, such as advertisements, top stories, or organic results. Google stood out with the most intuitive interface and the most relevant, up-to-date results, particularly in the way it categorizes and presents information, like showing featured snippets and related questions. From this activity, I also discovered that Google currently holds the largest market share among search engines. This insight into search engine behavior helps me better understand how online information is filtered and presented. In my current environment as a student and future professional, this knowledge will help me evaluate search results more critically and select the most reliable tools for research, whether for academic assignments, workplace tasks, or general problem solving.

Use Search Engines and Search Operators

In the *Use Search Engines* activity, I practiced using search operators like exact phrase matching, site-specific searches, and Boolean logic. I learned that using quotation marks for exact phrases, such as *"search engine" "market share"*, significantly narrows down results to more relevant and accurate sources. Similarly, using site-specific searches like *site\:wikiversity.org* helped me retrieve targeted content more efficiently than using the site’s own internal search function. The Boolean search using “search engine” OR SEO returned a broader range of results, allowing me to compare how different sources handle overlapping topics. This activity also involved evaluating the credibility of sources based on Georgetown's guidelines. I realized that using advanced search techniques not only improves the quality of my results but also saves time by filtering out less useful or less credible content. I can apply these skills in both academic and professional settings—when conducting market research, sourcing scholarly articles, or verifying online information—by using precise search strategies to find credible and high-quality information faster and more reliably.
